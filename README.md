INTRODUCTION
This project is a Java-based application developed using Spring Boot,
Spring Security, Lombok, Rest API, JPA Repository, JWT, 
Model Mapper, and H2 database. It aims to provide a foundation for building secure and efficient RESTful APIs.

FEATURES
Spring Boot: Provides a powerful framework for building standalone, production-grade applications.
Spring Security: Enables robust security features to protect your application endpoints and resources.
Lombok: Simplifies Java code by reducing boilerplate code with annotations.
Rest API: Implements RESTful architecture to expose endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation.
JPA Repository: Utilizes Java Persistence API for seamless database interactions.
JWT: Implements JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
Model Mapper: Facilitates object mapping between DTOs and entities to enhance data transfer efficiency.
H2 Database: Uses an in-memory database for development and testing purposes.

GETTING STARTED
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Build and run the application using your preferred IDE or the command-line interface.
The application will start, and you can access the endpoints via http://localhost:8080.

CONFIGURATION
Configure the application properties, such as database settings and security parameters, in the application.properties file.

USAGE
Use Postman for accessing the avaialble endpoints.
Make sure to authenticate and obtain a JWT token before accessing secured endpoints.
